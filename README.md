In the ancient art of Rock, Paper, Scissors, a deceptively simple game reveals the fascinating dynamics of human psychology.

With just three choices:

* the unyielding rock

* the versatile paper

* the swift scissors

Of course, rock beats scissors, scissors beat paper and paper beats rock.

# How it works?

First, the player enters one of the three choices above.

Then the computer randomly selects one aswell.

After that the winner is revealed and the score updates.

Before the game ends you will be asked if you want to continue playing or stop.
